- Total GPU Memory: 163,118 MiB (2 x 81,559 MiB)
- Driver Version: 570.148.08
- CUDA Version: 12.8

GPU Details:
GPU 0: NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3
- Bus ID: 00000000:06:00.0
- Memory: 81,559 MiB
- Power: 69W / 700W
- Temperature: 27°C
- Utilization: 0%

GPU 1: NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3
- Bus ID: 00000000:07:00.0
- Memory: 81,559 MiB
- Power: 70W / 700W
- Temperature: 28°C
- Utilization: 0%

Recommended Settings for Qwen2.5-VL-72B:
- Model Size: ~72B parameters
- Estimated Memory Usage: ~144GB (with bfloat16)
- Recommended Device: "auto" (will use both GPUs)
- Alternative: "cuda:0" or "cuda:1" for single GPU
- Batch Size: 1 (due to memory constraints)
- Max New Tokens: 1280
- Temperature: 0.0 (deterministic)

Memory Optimization Tips:
1. Use torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16 to reduce memory usage
2. Enable gradient checkpointing if available
3. Use device_map="auto" for automatic multi-GPU distribution
4. Consider using CPU offloading for very large models
5. Monitor GPU memory usage during inference

Performance Expectations:
- Single GPU: ~2-4 tokens/second
- Dual GPU: ~4-8 tokens/second
- Total inference time: 6-12 hours for 5376 questions
- Memory usage: ~80-90% of single GPU memory

Notes:
- H100 GPUs are excellent for large language models
- 80GB memory per GPU should be sufficient for 72B model
- Consider using mixed precision training/inference
- Monitor temperature and power usage during long runs
